Computer Graphics Project:- 

Line Clipping Using Cohen Sutherland algorithm

Description:-

This project tells about the implementation of line clipping by using the line clipping algorithm.

This algorithm deals with the line getting clipped.This was given by Cohen and Sutherland.

The object within the window is clipping and transformed onto the viewport.

This viewport and the window can be seen on the screen in a small pop up screen.

This code is written in C++ and openGL library is used.TBRL codes are assigned depending upon the postion of the line.
